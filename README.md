Skript is a plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people
to modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you
*do* know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used
for prototyping etc.

This GitHub fork of Skript is based on the SkriptLang fork, based on Mirreski's improvements
which was built on Njol's original Skript.

## Requirements
Skript requires **Spigot** to work. You heard it right, Bukkit does *not* work.
You can use Paper but I don't really recommend it for 1.8.

This fork of Skript is only available for Minecraft 1.8. Check above if you're
looking for 1.9+ compatibility.

## Download
You can find the downloads in the [releases page](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/releases).

## Documentation

## Issues and other stuff
Since this fork only provides retro-compatibility, issues regarding Skript will have to be posted
on the [official repository](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) of the plugin.

However, don't hesitate to report any problem which you believe directly related to
the plugin by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/Matocolotoe/Skript-1.8/issues).
