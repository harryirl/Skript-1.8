Skript is a plugin for Paper/Spigot, which allows server owners and other people to modify their servers without learning Java. It can also be useful if you
*do* know Java; some tasks are quicker to do with Skript, and so it can be used for prototyping etc.

This GitHub fork of Skript is based on the SkriptLang fork, based on Mirreski's improvements, which were built on Njol's original Skript.

## Requirements
Skript-1.8 requires **Spigot 1.8.8** (not Spigot 1.8.0, 1.8.3, ...) to work. You heard it right, Bukkit does *not* work.

This fork is only available for Minecraft 1.8. Check above if you're looking for 1.9+ compatibility.

## Download
